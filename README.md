# Stock-Price-Prediction-by-CNN-LSTM
To predict Tesla's stock prices using historical data, I developed a machine learning model that involved setting up the environment, preparing the data, creating and training the model, and evaluating its performance. Initially, I installed the yfinance library and imported essential libraries for data processing and machine learning. Using Yahoo Finance, I obtained historical stock price data for Tesla from January 2018 to December 2022.

Next, I scaled the data using MinMaxScaler and created feature sets and labels for training. The data was prepared for a CNN-LSTM hybrid model by reshaping it appropriately. I then implemented the CNN-LSTM model using Keras, adding convolutional layers for feature extraction and LSTM layers for capturing temporal dependencies. The model was compiled and trained on the prepared data over 100 epochs with a batch size of 16.

For evaluation, I tested the model on new data from January to April 2023. The model's predictions were compared with the actual stock prices, and various metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² score were calculated. The model achieved an RMSE of 8.74, an MAE-based accuracy of 93.28%, and an R² score of 90.28%. A visual comparison of the predicted and actual stock prices confirmed the model's effectiveness. The results demonstrated the model's capability to accurately predict Tesla's stock prices, providing valuable insights for future stock price forecasting.
